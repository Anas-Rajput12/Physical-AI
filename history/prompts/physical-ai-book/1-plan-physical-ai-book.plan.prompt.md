## Prompt

Create a step-by-step plan to write, structure, and deploy this book using:

- Spec-Kit Plus
- Claude Code
- Docusaurus
- GitHub Pages

The plan should include:
- Folder structure for Docusaurus
- Chapter writing order
- How Claude Code will be used per chapter
- Markdown standards
- Final deployment steps to GitHub Pages

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive implementation plan for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book. The plan includes: technical context with Docusaurus/Node.js stack, constitution check ensuring all principles are met, detailed project structure with Docusaurus organization, research findings on technology choices, data models for course content, quickstart guide for setup, and content contracts defining chapter requirements. All specifications follow the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution principles.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete implementation plan created with all required artifacts
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created plan.md, research.md, data-model.md, quickstart.md, and content-contract.md
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.tasks to generate implementation tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Plan comprehensively covers all user requirements with appropriate technical approach

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: none
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): All constitution checks passed
- Prompt variant (if applicable):
- Next experiment (smallest change to try):
