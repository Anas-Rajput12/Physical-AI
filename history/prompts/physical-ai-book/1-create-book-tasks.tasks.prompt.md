## Prompt

Break this project into clear implementation tasks.

Tasks must include:
- Docusaurus project setup
- Sidebar and navigation creation
- Writing each module as Markdown docs
- Adding code snippets (ROS 2, Python, Isaac)
- Capstone project walkthrough
- Testing build locally
- Deploying to GitHub Pages

Output tasks in a checklist format.

## Response snapshot

Created a comprehensive task breakdown for the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics book project with 61 specific implementation tasks organized into 9 phases. Tasks are organized by user story priority (P1-P3) with clear dependencies and parallel execution opportunities. Each task follows the required checklist format with sequential IDs, story labels where applicable, and specific file paths. The implementation strategy follows an incremental delivery approach starting with foundational setup before progressing through each chapter.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: Complete task breakdown created with 61 specific implementation tasks
- 🧪 Tests: none
- 📁 Files: Created tasks.md with comprehensive task list organized by user stories
- 🔁 Next prompts: /sp.implement to execute the tasks
- 🧠 Reflection: Tasks properly organized by user story priority with clear dependencies

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)
