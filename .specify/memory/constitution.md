# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics Constitution

## Core Principles

### Educational Excellence
All content must be accessible to senior undergraduate AI students; Explanations must be clear and progressive, building from fundamentals to advanced concepts; Every chapter must include learning objectives, key takeaways, and exercises with solutions.

### Technical Accuracy & Practical Relevance
Content must be factually accurate with real-world examples and applications; All concepts must be validated through practical implementation or simulation; Theory must be grounded in current industry practices and established research.

### Open Source & Accessibility
Preference for open-source tools and platforms (ROS 2, Gazebo, Unity Community Edition, NVIDIA Isaac Gym); All code examples must be freely available and well-documented; Content must be deployable via GitHub Pages using Docusaurus without proprietary dependencies.

### Visual Learning Enhancement
Diagrams, illustrations, and visual aids must be integrated throughout all chapters; All complex concepts must be accompanied by visual representations; Diagrams-in-text approach to enhance comprehension of physical AI and robotics concepts.

### Modular & Extensible Content
Each chapter must be modular and self-contained where possible; Content must be structured to allow easy updates as technology evolves; Clear inter-chapter dependencies and pathways for different learning tracks.

### Evidence-Based Approach
No unsupported claims, marketing language, or fluff content; All assertions must be backed by research papers, official documentation, or proven implementations; Critical evaluation of technologies and approaches must be emphasized.

## Target Audience & Educational Standards

Content is specifically designed for senior undergraduate AI students with foundational knowledge in mathematics, programming, and basic robotics. Material must bridge the gap between theoretical concepts and practical implementation in physical AI, embodied intelligence, and humanoid robotics. Each section must include prerequisites, estimated study time, and assessment rubrics aligned with university-level learning outcomes.

## Technical Content Standards

All content must incorporate the specified technologies: ROS 2 for robotics middleware, Gazebo for simulation environments, Unity for visualization and prototyping, NVIDIA Isaac for GPU-accelerated robotics, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models for embodied AI. Code examples must be tested and verified for accuracy, with clear explanations of implementation details and potential pitfalls.

## Development Workflow

Content creation follows an iterative process: outline → initial draft → technical review → student testing → revision → publication. All contributions must undergo peer review by domain experts. Documentation must be maintained in Markdown format compatible with Docusaurus, with automated build and deployment to GitHub Pages.

## Governance

This constitution governs all content creation and technical decisions for the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book project. All contributors must comply with these principles. Amendments require documented justification and approval from project maintainers. Content reviews must verify compliance with educational standards and technical accuracy.
