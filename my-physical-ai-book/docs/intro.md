# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence with the physical world through embodied systems. Unlike traditional AI that operates purely in digital spaces, Physical AI involves intelligent agents that interact with, perceive, and act upon the physical environment. This field encompasses robotics, embodied cognition, and the integration of perception, reasoning, and action in real-world contexts.

Physical AI systems must handle uncertainty, adapt to dynamic environments, and make decisions under real-time constraints. They combine machine learning, computer vision, natural language processing, and control theory to create agents that can navigate, manipulate, and interact with physical objects and environments.

## What is Embodied Intelligence?

Embodied intelligence is the theory that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's cognitive processes, its physical body, and the environment. Rather than treating the mind as separate from the body, embodied intelligence emphasizes that:

- The body's form and properties shape cognitive processes
- Sensorimotor interactions are fundamental to intelligence
- Environmental context is essential for meaningful behavior
- Physical constraints drive efficient solutions

In humanoid robotics, this means designing systems that leverage the physical properties of human-like bodies to achieve intelligent behavior, rather than simply programming abstract behaviors onto a physical platform.
